# Create a new folder called problem2 and put all problem2 related files in that folder including this file.
# Create a python file, say math_library.py, and add the functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
# In this file, call the functions addition, subtraction, multiplication and division that you defined in the math_library.py.
# Make sure that the program starts at the main function. Like in dinkelbach.py. Good job on the last one.
