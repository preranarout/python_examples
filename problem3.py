# Good job on the last one.
# Create a folder called problem3 and copy the math library that you created in problem2 
# and add square root and square functions. After that is done, copy this file problem3.py
# into that folder and call the functions of the math library. Ask the user for an input using
# command line arguments (argparse) to specify whether the user wants to add, subtract, 
# multiply, divide, perform square root or find the square of a number using a parameter.
#
# Example Usage:
#   $ python problem3.py --op_type 1 -n1 23 -n2 25
#   
# where op_type (1: add, 2: subtract, ... )
#       n1 is the first number
#       n2 is the second number (for square root and square, n2 need not be specified)
