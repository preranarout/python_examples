# Problem description:
# Take an input of two integers from the user and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using different functions and print the output.
# Also, make sure that your program can do the same functions for floating point values.

a, b = input("Enter two Integers: ")

Addition = a + b
print "The addition of a and b is:", Addition

Subtraction = a - b
print "The Subtraction of a and b is:", Subtraction

Multiplication = a * b
print "The Multiplication of a and b is:", Multiplication

Division = a / b
print "The Division of a and b is:", Division
